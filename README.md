Public Experience Network: Tapping Talent and Experience to Co-create Solutions to Government Challenges 
---------

This document is the outcome from a working group discussion at #FOCAS13. Please comment, modify and extend it.

This group got started with a discussion about 'Citizen-Government Interaction for Legislative or Regulatory Activities'. We converged on the concept of a register of citizen experts, comparable to organ donor registration (which in DC can be opted-into at the DMV). After further discussion, we focused on an approach that helps cities tap experience to address specific issues.


What's the problem solved by the Public Experience Network?
---------------------
There is no perfectly engaged citizen. No individual who participates in every single local meeting, responds to all calls for comment or draft proposals, attends each Council hearing, votes in every election. But most people are smart about something: riders of a specific bus line on how that impacts their commute, youth and their parents around a park.

Public Experience Network taps into the latent and under-used experience of citizens, and makes it accessible for city government. 

Who uses it?
---------------------
Government staff, by requesting expertise on specific local issues.

Citizens who self-identify as having some kind of expertise.


How do municipalities co-create with help from citizen expertise?
----------------

This is not about “asking” or "ideation", it’s about solving a clearly-defined problem.

Taps community talent that is going to waste.

Opportunity to shape future behavior -- creates a new experience of what civic engagement can be.

How people get involved (some combination of LinkedIn, in-person requests from gov, outreach at gas stations, etc)




What's the citizen experience?
----------------



Challenges and concerns
--------------

Does this set back open gov efforts -- if city governments invite contributions but don't act on them, or if they take bad advice and act on it? What does this informal approach to government do -- government is informal for a reason.

Start small and offline - find a topic area and a network, then build the tool later.

What's the right size of municipality for PEN? Maybe small ones where gov and citizens are already close?
