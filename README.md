Public Experience Network: Tapping Talent and Experience to Co-create Solutions to Government Challenges 
---------

This document is the outcome from a working group discussion at #FOCAS13. Please comment, modify and extend it.

This group got started with a discussion about 'Citizen-Government Interaction for Legislative or Regulatory Activities'. We converged on the concept of a register of citizen experts, comparable to donor registration (which in DC can be opted-into at the DMV). After further discussion, we focused on an approach that helps cities tap experience to address specific issues.
